# Quality Gates Test

This file tests the quality gates implementation:

✅ **CI Pipeline** - Should run tests and home inspection
✅ **PR Quality Summary** - Should comment with inspection score (fixed permissions)
✅ **Branch Protection** - Will be configured after this PR

Updated to trigger CI re-run after permissions fix.

This file can be deleted after testing.
